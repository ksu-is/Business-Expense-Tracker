# Business-Expense-Tracker
My idea for the class project would be to create a program that an abundance of different companies (corporate or family owned) would be able to use in order to track their different types of monthly business expenses. 
The code will be taken from an excel database using the curl function and would then be broken down through the program to monitor the different types of data and break them into their different expenses, 
and also output the total of all of the expenses together.
