# Business-Expense-Tracker
My idea for the class project would be to create a program that an abundance of different companies (corporate or family owned) would be able to use in order to track the total of their monthly business expenses. The code will be taken and will then be broken down through the program to monitor the different types of data and break them into their different expenses, and also output the total of all of the expenses together, and provide the amount remaining on the monthly budget if any.
